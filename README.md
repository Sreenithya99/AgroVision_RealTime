🌾 AgroVision RT – Real-Time Crop Yield Prediction Platform

AgroVision RT is a full-stack AI-powered platform that predicts crop yield in real time by combining satellite vegetation indices, live weather data, and machine learning models. The system helps farmers and researchers assess crop health and forecast productivity based on geographic location.

---

 Features

- 📍 Interactive map-based location selection  
- 🛰️ Real-time NDVI extraction from Sentinel-2 imagery  
- 🌦️ Live weather data (temperature, rainfall, humidity)  
- 🌱 Crop health classification  
- 📈 ML-based yield prediction (t/ha)  
- ✅ Confidence score for predictions  
- 📊 Historical trend charts  
- 📄 Auto-generated PDF reports  

---

 How It Works

1. User selects a location on the map.
2. NDVI is fetched from Sentinel-2 via Sentinel Hub Process API.
3. Current weather data is retrieved from OpenWeatherMap.
4. Features are passed to a trained scikit-learn model.
5. System returns:
   - NDVI value  
   - Weather parameters  
   - Crop health status  
   - Predicted yield  
   - Confidence score  
6. Results are visualized using charts and downloadable reports.

 Machine Learning

* Model trained using datasets from Kaggle and data.gov.in
* Algorithm: Regression-based scikit-learn model
* Output: Yield prediction (tons/hectare) + confidence score

⚠️ Trained `.pkl` files are excluded via `.gitignore`.
Models can be regenerated using provided training scripts.
